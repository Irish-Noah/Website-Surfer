# Website-Surfer
This is a work in progress program that will let me open google chrome and surf the web just using my voice. Might be intergrated to my Chat-Bot repository eventually
Also want it to be able to scrap transcripts off the YouTube videos that I have made so that I can make a list of my top ten most said words for no reason other than my enjoyment
(don't know how to just yet, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there lol)
